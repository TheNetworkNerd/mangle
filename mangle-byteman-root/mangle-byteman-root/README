Byteman README
--------------

Byteman supports injection of side effects into Java programs for the
purpose of tracing and testing application behaviour.

Installation
------------

When you unzip the downloaded release it will explode to a single
target install directory containing everything you need to
use byteman. You should set environment variable BYTEMAN_HOME so
that it points to this target install directory.

The install directory for the binary release contains the following
subdirectories

  bin -- contains Unix scripts to simplify: using Byteman (bmjava.sh);
      typechecking Byteman rule scripts (bytemancheck.sh);
      communicating with the Byteman agent listener (bmsubmit.sh);
      and installing the agent into a running JVM (bminstall.sh).
      You will need to change the permissions of these files
      in order to execute them directly from the command line.

  lib -- contains the Byteman agent and rule engine (byteman.jar);
      the subset of this code needed to compile/run the submit
      client (byteman-submit.jar); the subset of this code needed
      to compile/run the install client (byteman-install.jar).
