/**
 *
 * i) Fault when injected will follow the following steps of execution 1. Construct the task object
 * 2. Store in the DB 3. Trigger TaskCreatedEvent 4. TaskCreatedListener will add the task to the
 * hazelcast cluster cache 5. Hazelcast will put this task into its distributed-map 6. Depending on
 * which partition this task was added into, it will trigger an entryAdded event in its respective
 * node 7. Listener to this event will trigger the execution of the task on that particular node
 *
 * ii) When new member joins the cluster 1. The partition ownership of some of the partitions are
 * moved to new cluster member 2. No re-triggering of the tasks will be carried out 3. Task that
 * were being executed by the old owner of the partition will remain to be executed on the old owner
 * Summary: only partition ownership will be transferred
 *
 * iii) When an existing cluster member leaves the cluster 1. Membership event is generated - Tasks
 * that were still running on the old owner, but whose ownership were assigned to the new owner will
 * be re-triggered 2. Migration event is generated - Partitions owned by the dead node will be
 * distributed across the existing cluster nodes - Tasks that are part of dead cluster member will
 * be re-triggered, on the new owner of the respective partitions
